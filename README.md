# Aquaporin-4-IHC
In this study we recreated an experiment published by Hablitz et al., 2020, which
analysed the circadian control over the perivascular polarization of the water channel
protein AQP-4. In our experiment, we were able to replicate the results but also approached
the data analysis in a different manner which lead us to question the method used in
Hablitz et al., publication. We also found, using mice with a abnormal circadian clock
(total Per2 knockouts), that these mutants may have a more active glymphatic system
than wild type mice. This finding may be a good starting point for further studies
involving the glymphatic system and its relationship with the circadian rhythm.
